Blake is the buff and white boy, and Toby is the black and white boy. Both boys are on the larger size for cockers (over 40 pounds) and are currently living in Washington State. Sadly, their original owner could no longer take care of them and handed them off to a relative who is already overwhelmed with her own personal 5 dogs and does not have her own house until after the first of the year. They are very sweet boys, but they have not been socialized with other dogs, so the situation is tough. The boys are spending a lot of time in crates just to keep the peace. This is not good for them and the kind hearted lady who is taking care of them knows that. She wants them to have a good life. They have common issues, cherry eye, dry eye, cocker ears and skin allergies. She is willing to help out with medical expenses but needs to get them out of her temporary home and into a foster or adoptive home. We think it would be ok to separate them as some of the behavior may tone down if they are separated (litter-mate syndrome). Both boys are 6 years old, neutered and housebroken. It would be best for them to go to a home with no other pets until they can be socialized properly. Blake is initially more shy than Toby, and Toby is more active.

How could anybody say \u201cNO\u201d to that face?? Diesel is a young boy that came to the shelter as a stray. He is good with other dogs and enjoys off leash doggy playgroups. He knows basic commands and is house/leash trained. He must've had a family/person that loved him at some point. Diesel has met male and female dogs of different sizes. He interacts but isn't overly playful. He's patient with young, overzealous dogs, but would likely prefer to be in a home with another dog(s) that has a more mellow vibe. He may be able to live with cats and other smaller animals, but would need to be monitored and trained in how to coexist.\n\nWhat shelter staff & volunteers had to say about Diesel:\nDiesel is a handsome blockhead of a boy, with a bobbed tail that likes to wiggle when he's feeling good. Excellent on leash, he's a gentleman on walks, with an easygoing demeanor. Diesel likes to hang out with other dogs, even if he doesn't play, and could sit or lie by your side for hours so long as you're paying attention to him. A pretty mellow dude, Diesel would likely be just as happy on a camping or\nhiking trip as he would couch surfing and watching a movie with his person.\n\nPlease contact Espanola Humane for more information and to arrange a meet n' greet.
