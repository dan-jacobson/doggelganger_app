{"id": 74269580, "name": "Irwin", "breed": "Australian Shepherd & Great Pyrenees Mix", "age": "Young", "sex": "Male", "location": {"city": "Nashville", "state": "TN", "postcode": ""}, "description": "In Murfreeseboro-Irwin is a young Australian Shepherd mix who will quickly work his way into your heart. We don\u2019t know what the mix is, but his foster parents guess he has a little Pyrenees in him based on his paw gestures, herding style and eyes. \n\nHe\u2019s about 3 years old (though could be younger, the vet could give a better estimate if Irwin would let them look at his teeth), and 54 lbs. \n\nIrwin\u2019s origins are unknown, then he spent several months at a rural shelter and was up for euthanasia when ASF stepped in and saved his life! He is very timid at first and took several weeks at his foster home to relax and start to show his personality. This is a recurring theme with him, he needs time and space to adjust to new people, places and things. Slow introductions to people and dogs will help Irwin to be successful in the long run. He also does best with some initial boundaries, stick to the butt scratches until he knows you please!\n\nIrwin is a medium energy dog, he needs daily exercise but he\u2019s not an overachiever. A few 15 minute play sessions or a couple miles on a walk and he\u2019ll be good to go. Irwin\u2019s like his foster dad, you better get all the walking in you want to do because once he gets back to the car he\u2019s ready to go home and take a nap. \n\nTennis balls produce much prancing around in excitement for you to throw them in the backyard; he loves a good game of fetch. Irwin can get over excited during backyard playtimes; this is manifested in jumping and nipping (at the same time). And let me tell you this boy can JUMP. A nip on your head is easy peasy for him! He\u2019s working on more appropriate behaviors at his foster home, but will need continued training. It\u2019s for this reason that children should be at least 12 years old. I know he won\u2019t bite but even at a sturdy 33 years old it\u2019s intimidating to see him run full speed across the yard and then jump! A fenced yard would be great but must be 6 feet, a 4 foot fence won\u2019t hold this boy.\n\nIrwin\u2019s most defining characteristic is that he\u2019s a big ol\u2019 love bug. He would like constant attention! If you\u2019re not doing anything, you should be petting him. If you\u2019re doing something, you should be petting him. He will use his paws to pull your hand to pets if not otherwise occupied or nudge you to remind you to keep rubbing his belly. He is never more than about 15 feet from his foster mom and loves to \u201cgo\u201d if that means staying with his people. \n\nWhile he can stay home alone (in a crate or uncrated), he would do best if not left alone for too long daily. If you do leave him, he will need a commensurate amount of time devoted to loving on him when you return. Irwin would do fine as an only dog or with a canine companion, just keep in mind it will take him a while to warm up to his new dog pal.\n\nIrwin is working on curbing his jumping, but you should jump at the chance to meet this charming fellow!\n\nCurrently fostered in Murfreesboro, TN. There is an additional $20 microchip fee which includes registration and transfer to his new furever family.\n\nHere is the application: https://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application", "url": "https://www.petfinder.com/dog/irwin-74269580/tn/nashville/australian-shepherds-furever-ca2261/", "primary_photo": "irwin_australian_shepherd___great_pyrenees_mix_nashville.jpg", "primary_photo_cropped": "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/a974bb41-9770-4c08-a853-7f2c5848e768.jpg?versionId=1sFIPwGnESjyOLWiCozO_Hc8jLQqVi5p&bust=1733543791", "photo_urls": ["https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/a974bb41-9770-4c08-a853-7f2c5848e768.jpg?versionId=1sFIPwGnESjyOLWiCozO_Hc8jLQqVi5p&bust=1733543791", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/62dee79b-8130-4130-accc-1fb2484dfabf.jpg?versionId=qItPNZgl_QD9K7OevXaNsZYlYL7k2UBR&bust=1733543795", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/24a2737b-5de5-496c-a923-6568d8dcbfdd.jpg?versionId=mxIlgTuXO8dv_0zNiZW.ipIQkQFIoY46&bust=1733543800", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/70ccbf66-2489-4dfd-bae8-27981d476d39.jpg?versionId=RLnYaJ0Pnsj7n.IyO3gyX2gPHCgUFSBj&bust=1733543802", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/3cf40f0e-444c-4a9d-93d2-00fabe7dd2e0.jpg?versionId=yd1c1qsqAso9WORCqNFMbdxrT7ZFHgBm&bust=1733543805", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/f2f74073-3ca5-4537-8e2d-5c6d3b1cf37d/image/45330d88-1cfb-4ace-80c5-9adf6719ef34.jpg?versionId=iU7WjSGtaMYHBoPx.APVfQyfQiynnOo4&bust=1733543829"]}

{"id": 72167726, "name": "Cucumber - Mild-Mannered, Trained", "breed": "German Shepherd Dog & American Staffordshire Terrier Mix", "age": "Young", "sex": "Male", "location": {"city": "Walnut Creek", "state": "CA", "postcode": ""}, "description": "Cucumber's greatest hits: https://tinyurl.com/yra99uu3\n\nMy heart fills with love with I think of Cucumber. I've been fostering him since Oct 2023, and have treated him as my own. He has made amazing strides during that time, and I know will only shine brighter with continued guidance and nurturing.\n\nCucumber is mild-mannered and has already had more foundational training under his belt than most dogs have in their lifetime.  He's about 80 lbs, 1.5 years old, and a beautiful mix of Siberian husky, German shepherd, American Staffie, pittie, and a touch of doberman. His age, size, and mix may lead you to think he's a handful but such is not a case at all. \n\nSome of his qualities:\n\n* Housetrained\n\n* Crate-trained. He LOVES his crate!\n\n* Quiet. Not at all a nuisance barker, even when the little yappy dogs next door fence bark at him.\n\n* Walks well on leash. \n\n* Rides calmly in the car.\n\n* Great off-leash. While he hasn't been formally trained on recall, he is responsive when I call his name during our hikes.\n\n* Highly food-motivated -- great for training1\n\n* Tolerant with being handled by those he trusts. He doesn't mind having his nails dremeled, teeth brushed, or being given a bath. \n\n* A follower who wants to please. He just needs to understand what you're asking of him.\n\n* Some commands that have been introduced: sit, down, stay, roll over, spin, wait, look, with me, leave it. Also trained to be comfortable with a gentle leader, soft cone of shame, and muzzle, to wait at the door before being released, and extended down-stays.\n\n* Good with most dogs. (Note: he is very vocal when playing and makes growly and barky noises, which may be off-putting to some dogs--and humans--not familiar with this, but it is just his form of play.)\n\n* More on the submissive side.  Easily corrected.\n\n* Would be fine as an only dog or in a multi-dog household.\n\n* Loves to fetch. He will bring the ball back.\n\n* Loves water.\n\n* Not high energy. \n\n* Mellow and well-behaved in the house.\n\n* Affectionate but not needy.\n\n* SUPER lovable!\n\nEvery single person who has spent quality time with Cucumber knows what a wonderful dog he is. His disposition is so good-natured. He is a devoted companion and the best side-kick. He'll make you laugh and fill your heart with immense joy, as he's done for me. It has been an honor to help this boy blossom, and I hope his new family appreciates him as much as I do, and as much as he deserves.\n\nWatch Cucumber's complete playlist here:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2s39k33b\n\nAdoption requirements:  minimum 24 years of age", "url": "https://www.petfinder.com/dog/cucumber-mild-mannered-trained-72167726/ca/walnut-creek/walkin-the-bark-rescue-ca1169/", "primary_photo": "cucumber_-_mild-mannered__trained_german_shepherd_dog___american_staffordshire_terrier_mix_walnut_creek.jpg", "primary_photo_cropped": "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/89e6b5b2-12a7-4767-aadc-201bca71c449/image/c2d4a076-4819-4a7c-ac25-9d560257182c.jpg?versionId=LXeDDZfW62kp6QJ32VqnHgZdica_3UhB&bust=1719358913", "photo_urls": ["https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/89e6b5b2-12a7-4767-aadc-201bca71c449/image/c2d4a076-4819-4a7c-ac25-9d560257182c.jpg?versionId=LXeDDZfW62kp6QJ32VqnHgZdica_3UhB&bust=1719358913", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/89e6b5b2-12a7-4767-aadc-201bca71c449/image/be1c2635-1032-4e1e-87b5-e6acfdc8061b.jpg?versionId=i75yasD6a0VJcBkR.gD3j_reYPBpnSgH&bust=1719365975", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/89e6b5b2-12a7-4767-aadc-201bca71c449/image/fdf396eb-652d-458c-8efc-d10c11d03cc2.jpg?versionId=TvBAfn1YGYknQ.rYR8Q5sraePeFlbSpo&bust=1719365976", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/89e6b5b2-12a7-4767-aadc-201bca71c449/image/8b8b7977-cca2-49e4-8aaa-52edf296344f.jpg?versionId=dfPDgWCwQ7iXjQKFS4miCs8s9UZiMyQh&bust=1719365976", "https://dbw3zep4prcju.cloudfront.net/animal/89e6b5b2-12a7-4767-aadc-201bca71c449/image/5a2ccad7-8264-4a2f-a29d-13fad4ae04a4.jpg?versionId=pE6JNgmIB4trIZKd2dcNMKCJSII50zJb&bust=1719365967"]}
